The governance process is designed to be as supportive and light touch as possible so that teams are helped to deliver solutions that comply with the Enterprise Architecture and operate in an agile manner within the guidelines laid down.
There are three specific [contexts](../../context/drivers/index.md.njk "Internal Drivers") when the Enterprise Architecture governance process applies
![Image of when the EA governance process applies](./architecture-governance-context.png "Architecture Governance Context")
- When creating a tender in order to go out to market 
- The Discovery phase of the agile delivery process
- The Beta phase of the agile delivery process

The following governance process applies to each context:

The process consists of up to 11 steps as follows:
